## Keystone project
Tunable nonlinear light generation with a quantum material metasurface
Designed metasurface structures made of a Dirac semimetal and built advanced optical experiments to validate efficient tunable nonlinear generation (design → alignment/measurement → analysis).

- **Result:** Demonstrated efficient second harmonic generation(SHG) in the far infrared, enhanced by electric fields confined in the metasurface 
- **Tools:** FDTD/FEM, Python/MATLAB, Nonlinear optics, Optical systems design and characterization
- **My role:** Designed the structure on CST Microwave studio + Ansys HFSS, developed advanced optical characterization, and validated results through analysis in MATLAB
