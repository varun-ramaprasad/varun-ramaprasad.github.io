title: About
---
I’m a final-year Physics PhD researcher at UC San Diego who builds optical and electromagnetic systems end-to-end—from physical design and simulation to experimental validation and automated data pipelines.<br>
My background is deeply hands-on. Over the past five+ years, I’ve designed, assembled, and debugged advanced optical experiments involving high-power lasers, cryogenic platforms, and custom photonic devices. My doctoral work centers on engineering metasurface-enabled nonlinear light–matter interactions, where I led both the device design and the experimental verification, translating electromagnetic theory into working hardware.<br>
A core strength of mine is bridging modeling and experiment. I routinely develop predictive electromagnetic simulations (FDTD, FEM) to guide design decisions, reduce prototyping cycles, and interpret complex optical measurements. I’m comfortable moving between simulation tools (CST Microwave Studio, FEM/FDTD solvers), mechanical design (SolidWorks), and data-driven workflows in MATLAB and Python for instrument control, analysis, and visualization. <br>
Beyond the lab, I value leadership and clear technical communication. I was selected by faculty for a competitive instructional leadership role at UCSD, where I trained and supervised over 50 PhD-level teaching assistants. I also enjoy translating complex physics into accessible narratives and hold a certification in science communication from the Fleet Science Center.<br>
I’m excited by roles that combine optics/photonics, electromagnetic modeling, and experimental validation in an applied R&D environment—especially where close collaboration between simulation, hardware, and measurement drives real-world impact.

## Keystone project
Tunable nonlinear light generation with a quantum material metasurface<br>
Built a metasurface-based photonic device integrated with a quantum material to dramatically enhance nonlinear optical interactions. Developed a custom optical measurement system to demonstrate a 100× increase in nonlinear light generation.   


- **Result:** Plasmonic field confinement combined with a low-loss quantum material platform enables highly efficient second-harmonic generation.
- **Tools:** FDTD/FEM, Nonlinear optics, Optical systems design and characterization, Python/MATLAB
- **My role:** Designed the structure on CST Microwave studio + Ansys HFSS, developed advanced optical characterization, and validated results through analysis in MATLAB
