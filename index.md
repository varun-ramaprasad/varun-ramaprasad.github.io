## Keystone project
Tunable nonlinear light generation with a quantum material metasurface<br>
Built a metasurface-based photonic device integrated with a quantum material to dramatically enhance nonlinear optical interactions. Developed a custom optical measurement system to demonstrate a 100× increase in nonlinear light generation.   


- **Result:** Plasmonic field confinement combined with a low-loss quantum material platform enables highly efficient second-harmonic generation.
- **Tools:** FDTD/FEM, Nonlinear optics, Optical systems design and characterization, Python/MATLAB
- **My role:** Designed the structure on CST Microwave studio + Ansys HFSS, developed advanced optical characterization, and validated results through analysis in MATLAB
